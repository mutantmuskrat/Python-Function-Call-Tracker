# Python-Function-Call-Tracker
This is a simple tool (still far from perfect) that can find and map function calls in a project.

## How to use
First, clone the project using
```
git clone https://github.com/mutantmuskrat/Python-Function-Call-Tracker.git
```

The entrypoint is ```calltrack.py```. To run it, use the following syntax:
```
python calltrack.py [absolute path to entrypoint file] [name of entry-point function]
```
### Example
```
python calltrack.py /home/user/calltrack.py main
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The path to your code MUST be absolute

This will navigate through the parent directory of the entrypoint file searching for any called functions. For each function found, it will find each function it calls. If the same function is called twice, the system adds the calling function to the "called by" list for that function. At the end, a csv file is generated. You will be prompted to either enter a description of each function in the codebase, or lookup details about a given function.
